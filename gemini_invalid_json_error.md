Okay, the error "Failed to parse Gemini response. The model did not return valid JSON" when using `model = gemini-2.0-flash` is a different issue, but it gives us valuable information!

**Understanding the "Invalid JSON" Error**

This error means that while the API call itself is now succeeding (we're past the "model not found" error), the *response* from the `gemini-2.0-flash` model is not in the JSON format that our backend code is expecting when it tries to extract the text.

**Likely Causes:**

1.  **`gemini-2.0-flash` Response Format is Different:** The most probable reason is that `gemini-2.0-flash` might not return its text content in the same structured JSON format as `gemini-pro`. It could be returning:
    *   **Plain Text:**  Perhaps it's designed for speed and simplicity and just returns the raw text response directly, without any JSON wrapper.
    *   **A Different JSON Structure:**  It might be returning JSON, but with a different structure than what the `@google/generative-ai` SDK and our code are designed to handle by default when using `.response.text()`.
    *   **Something else entirely:** Though less likely, it's possible the format is not even text-based JSON.

2.  **SDK Assumption:**  Our current backend code, specifically the line `const geminiResponse = result.response.text();`, assumes that `result.response` will be an object from which we can extract text using `.text()`.  This assumption might hold for `gemini-pro` but not for `gemini-2.0-flash`.

**Troubleshooting Steps & Solution**

To fix this, we need to understand the *actual* response structure from `gemini-2.0-flash`.  Here's how we'll investigate and adjust:

**Step 1: Inspect the Raw API Response (Backend Modification)**

We'll modify the backend API route (`pages/api/gemini.js`) to log the *entire* `result.response` object to the server console. This will show us exactly what the Gemini API is sending back when we use `gemini-2.0-flash`.

Modify your `pages/api/gemini.js` like this temporarily:

```javascript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // ... (rest of your code remains the same until the result processing) ...

        const result = await generativeModel.generateContent({
            generationConfig,
            safetySettings,
            contents: [{ role: 'user', parts }],
        });

        // ---  MODIFIED SECTION: Log the entire result.response ---
        console.log("Gemini API Response (gemini-2.0-flash):", result.response);

        // --- Original line that caused the error (comment it out for now) ---
        // const geminiResponse = result.response.text();

        // ---  Instead of extracting .text(), just send the whole response object back for now ---
        return res.status(200).json({ response: result.response });
        // ---------------------------------------------------------


    } catch (error) {
        // ... (error handling remains the same) ...
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the Modification:**

*   **`console.log("Gemini API Response (gemini-2.0-flash):", result.response);`**: This line will print the complete `result.response` object to your Next.js server's console when you make an API call.
*   **`// const geminiResponse = result.response.text();`**: We are commenting out the line that was causing the error because we suspect `.text()` is not the correct way to extract the text from `gemini-2.0-flash`'s response.
*   **`return res.status(200).json({ response: result.response });`**:  Instead of trying to process the response on the backend and extract text, we are now just sending the entire `result.response` object back to the frontend as JSON.

**Step 2: Run Your Frontend and Make an API Call**

1.  Make sure your Next.js development server is running (`npm run dev`).
2.  In your browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  **Crucially, in the "Model" dropdown, select or type in `gemini-2.0-flash`**.
4.  Enter your API Key, a prompt, and click "Generate Response".

**Step 3: Examine the Server Console and Browser Response**

*   **Server Console:** Look at your terminal where you are running `npm run dev`. You should see the output from `console.log("Gemini API Response (gemini-2.0-flash):", result.response);`.  Copy and paste the entire logged object here so we can analyze its structure.
*   **Browser Developer Tools (Network Tab):** Open your browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element", then go to the "Network" tab).
    *   Look for the API request to `/api/gemini`.
    *   Click on that request.
    *   Go to the "Response" tab.  You should see the JSON response that your backend is sending back, which is the same `result.response` object.  Copy and paste this JSON response here as well.

**Step 4: Analyze the Response Structure**

Once you have the logged output and the browser response, examine them carefully.  We need to answer these questions:

*   **Is it JSON?** Is the browser response showing valid JSON in the "Response" tab? If not, that's very important to know.
*   **What is the Structure?**  If it *is* JSON, what are the keys and values in the object?  Look for any keys that might contain the generated text.  Common keys in similar APIs might be something like `text`, `content`, `output`, `candidates`, `parts`, etc.
*   **Is there a `.text()` property or method?**  Look within the logged object structure.  Do you see anything resembling a `.text` property or a function that might be used to get the text?

**Step 5: Adjust Backend Code Based on Response Structure**

Based on what you find in Step 4, we will modify the backend code again to correctly extract the text response from the `gemini-2.0-flash` response.  Possible adjustments might include:

*   **Different Property Access:** If the text is under a different key (e.g., `result.response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text`), we'll update the code to access that key path.
*   **Different SDK Method:**  If there's a different SDK method needed for `gemini-2.0-flash` to get the text, we'll use that instead of `.text()`.
*   **Direct Text Handling (if not JSON):**  If it's plain text, we might need to skip JSON processing altogether and handle it as a string.

Let's start with Step 1 and Step 2. Run the modified code, make an API call with `gemini-2.0-flash`, and then paste the server console output and the browser's network response here. That will give us the information we need to proceed to Step 3 and beyond!
