The error message `models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp is not found for API version v1` clearly indicates that the model name `"gemini-2.0-flash-exp"` is not recognized by the Google Gemini API.

Let's troubleshoot this and figure out the correct model to use:

**Understanding the Error**

* **"models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp is not found"**: This is the core of the issue. The API endpoint is looking for a model with this specific identifier, and it doesn't exist or isn't accessible in the way you're trying to use it.
* **"for API version v1"**: This confirms you're using API version 1, which is generally the correct version for the current Gemini API.
* **"or is not supported for generateContent"**: While less likely in this case (since `generateContent` is the standard method), it's a secondary possibility.  However, the primary error is "not found", so the model itself is the first thing to investigate.
* **"Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods."**:  This is the **key instruction** from the API. It's telling you to query the API itself to get a list of valid model names.

**Common Causes and Solutions**

1.  **Incorrect Model Name:**
    *   **Most Likely Cause:**  `"gemini-2.0-flash-exp"` might be an outdated, internal, or experimental model name that is not intended for public use with the `generateContent` API.  Model names can change, and experimental models might not be generally available.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Use `gemini-pro` (Recommended):** In the code example I provided, the default and recommended model is `"gemini-pro"`.  This is a stable and generally available model for text generation. **Try changing your `model` input in your frontend to `gemini-pro` and try again.**
        *   **Check Google Cloud AI Studio for Available Models:**  The best way to know for sure is to look at the Google Cloud AI Studio (where you likely got your API key).  It should list the models available to you.  Look for models officially documented for text generation.
        *   **Consult Google Gemini API Documentation:** Refer to the official Google Gemini API documentation to see the current list of supported models for the `generateContent` endpoint.  Search for "Google Gemini API models" in your browser.

2.  **Typo in Model Name:**
    *   **Less Likely, but Possible:** Double-check for any typos when you are setting the `model` value in your frontend (or if you've hardcoded it anywhere). Even a small typo will cause the API to not recognize the model.
    *   **Solution:** Carefully re-examine the model name you are using to ensure it exactly matches a valid model name.

3.  **Model Not Available in Your Region/Project (Less Common for `gemini-pro`):**
    *   In rare cases, certain models might be restricted to specific regions or require specific project configurations.  However, `gemini-pro` is generally widely available.
    *   **Solution (If other models also fail):**
        *   **Check Google Cloud Console:** Verify your Google Cloud project settings and region if you suspect region restrictions.
        *   **Contact Google Cloud Support:** If you're confident you are using a valid model name and still get errors, you might need to contact Google Cloud support to inquire about model availability for your project and region.

4.  **API Key Issues (Less Likely for "Model Not Found", but worth a quick check):**
    *   While the error message specifically points to the model, a completely invalid or improperly configured API key *could* in some cases lead to unexpected errors.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Verify API Key:**  Double-check that you have correctly copied and pasted your API key into the input field in your frontend.
        *   **Regenerate API Key (If Necessary):**  In Google Cloud AI Studio, you can regenerate your API key to ensure it's valid. **If you regenerate, remember to update it in your frontend!**

**Steps to Resolve (Most Likely and Easiest First)**

1.  **Change Model to `gemini-pro`:** In your `pages/index.js` file, make sure the default value for the `model` state is set to `"gemini-pro"` and try running your code again.  If you've changed the `value` attribute in your `<select>` input, revert it to:

    ```javascript
    <select
        id="model"
        className="..."
        value={model}
        onChange={(e) => setModel(e.target.value)}
    >
        <option value="gemini-pro">gemini-pro</option>
        {/* ... other options if you add them later ... */}
    </select>
    ```

2.  **Verify Model Input in Frontend:**  Make absolutely sure you are selecting or inputting the model name correctly in your running web application. If you are manually typing it in somewhere, double-check for typos.

3.  **Check Google Cloud AI Studio for Model List:**  Go to Google Cloud AI Studio (where you manage your Gemini API access). Look for a section that lists the available models. Confirm that `gemini-pro` (or other models you intend to use) are listed there as available for your project.

4.  **Consult Google Gemini API Documentation:**  Search for the official Google Gemini API documentation. Look for the "Models" section to get the most up-to-date list of supported model names for the `generateContent` endpoint.

**If after trying these steps, you *still* get the 404 error, then:**

*   **Provide More Information:** Share the following:
    *   **Exact Model Name you are using:** Copy and paste the exact string you are using for the model.
    *   **Where you got the model name `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` from:**  If you remember where you saw this model name, it might give context (e.g., an old article, a different API, etc.).
    *   **Confirm `gemini-pro` also fails:** Let me know if you also get an error when you try to use `"gemini-pro"` specifically.
    *   **Your Google Cloud AI Studio/Gemini API setup:** (If you are comfortable)  Mention if you are using a personal project, a Google Cloud organization project, etc.  This might help identify if there are specific account configurations affecting model access.

By systematically checking these points, you should be able to pinpoint the issue and get your Gemini API calls working correctly. Let me know what you find after trying these troubleshooting steps!
